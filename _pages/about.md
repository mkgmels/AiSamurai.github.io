# Hi, I'm Mohamed Khaled Gaber!

Welcome to my website! 

I’m a machine learning and deep learning practitioner, and I love diving into data to uncover insights that can make a difference. My journey began in civil engineering — I graduated from Alexandria University in 2019. However, my passion for technology and curiosity about how data can drive innovation led me to transition into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence.

On this site, I’ll be sharing blog posts, tutorials, code snippets, and resources related to machine learning, deep learning, and more. Whether you're just starting out or looking to dive deeper into the field, I hope you find something useful here.

Feel free to explore, learn, and connect!
